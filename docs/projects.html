            <h2 class="title">FINAL YEAR GAME</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">In my final year, I developed a 2D action-platformer game in Unity, themed around medieval fantasy, featuring responsive player controls and enemy AI using state-driven logic. I designed modular systems using C# and key design patterns (Singleton, Factory, State) to support features including a stat upgrade system and dynamic achievement tracking. I gained experience in animation syncing, scene transitions, and architecting scalable UI across multiple gameplay states.

            <h2 class="title">ROADMAP VISUALISATION</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">I developed an interactive roadmap visualising Infosumâ€™s key deliverables across past, present, and future timelines. The project dynamically mapped data from a Jira CSV file and was built using TypeScript, Vite, and modular design principles. The UI was designed in Figma and refined through iterative design reviews. This internship deepened my understanding of agile development and strengthened my ability to deliver production-ready features in a collaborative environment.</p>
